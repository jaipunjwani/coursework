# plot the ratio of male to female trips by age

# plot the minimum temperature over each day

# plot the minimum temperature and maximum temperature over each day

# plot trip and weather data
########################################

# join trips and weather
trips_with_weather <- inner_join(trips, weather, by="ymd")

# plot the number of trips as a function of the minimum temperature, where each point represents a day
# you'll need to summarize the trips and join to the weather data to do this

# repeat this, splitting results by whether there was substantial precipitation or not
# you'll need to decide what constitutes "substantial precipitation" and create a new T/F column to indicate this

# add a smoothed fit on top of the previous plot, using geom_smooth

# compute the average number of trips and standard deviation in number of trips by hour of the day
# hint: use the hour() function from the lubridate package

# plot the above

# repeat this, but now split the results by day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...) or weekday vs. weekend days
# hint: use the wday() function from the lubridate package
